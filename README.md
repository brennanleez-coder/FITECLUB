# FITECLUB
Proposal for Orbital 2021
 
Team Name:
 
Analytic(tokers)

Proposed Level of Achievement:
 
Apollo 11

Motivation:

Tired of asking your friends or Google where to eat and getting anything as an answer? Excited to go to a certain restaurant but only to find out that it is fully packed? Craving a certain cuisine but cannot find your desired search results?

Many foodies have reached the point where online searches give them repetitive results and eventually choose to eat something that they are not satisfied with. Additionally, they have to make multiple searches in order to get all the answers that they want. So why isn’t there an application that can help provide all the answers in one search without having to waste time doing multiple separate searches. 


Aim:
 
We hope to make the Q&A process in forums quick and engaging through messaging platforms (e.g. Telegram).

Our team hopes to expedite the process of finding an eatery where it matches the user’s food craving for the day. Food reviews by other users can also be accessed to further provide an accurate experience at the eatery. 

 
User Stories:
 (A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. It's tempting to think that user stories are, simply put, software system requirements.)

[Please describe what the users would be able to do with your system.]
 
As the developer, I would want to be able to receive user feedback and regularly update my application and make it compatible with various devices.
As a hangry(hungry + angry) individual, I would want to eat at a place where it satisfies all your cravings. 
As a busy-individual with no time to waste before his/her next appointment, I would want to go to the nearest eatery that is able to have low crowd levels and satisfy cravings at the same time.
As a user with no mobile data, I would still like to be able to search for nearby eateries of my preferred craving.
As an eatery owner, I want to be able to provide the crowd level in my restaurants during different times of the day and to see my ranking and reviews make appropriate improvements to my service.
As a reviewer, I want to be able to rate the food and subsequently provide food recommendations for other users.
